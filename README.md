# ChatApp
Basic chat app built in Socket.io and Express. It was mostly made by me following the documentation on the Getting Started guide on Socket.io's documentation, but I just added some username functionality. The app is ugly
but this was mostly meant for learning as opposed to something I would show in production. 

Also, it's unclear, but the top form is for you to type a username. 

I also wanted to save my Mongo Free Storage, so this app does not persistently store chat information. If you exit the tab, anything on your screen will be gone forever.
